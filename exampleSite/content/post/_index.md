# Hugo(Head 1)

## Template Files(Head 2)

### HTML(Head 3)

Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where itâ€™s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.
